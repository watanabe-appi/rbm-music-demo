# RBM Music Demo Site

This page presents piano pieces automatically composed using a **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**. You can view the piano-roll images and listen to the audio below.


## Generated Musics

The following is a piece generated by an RBM that was trained on J. S. Bachâ€™s works represented as piano roll images.

In the case of generating two measures.

In the case of generating eight measures.

## Chord Progression

The following is an example of chord progressions generated by the RBM. While each individual chord is not particularly unnatural, the sequence of chords still appears awkward, suggesting that the model has not acquired an understanding of chord progression.
